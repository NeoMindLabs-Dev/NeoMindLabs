# 🧠 NeoMindLabs – Where Mechatronics Meets Code

Welcome to **NeoMindLabs**, a personal portfolio showcasing the fusion of **hardware intelligence** and **software engineering**. This is where my passion for **Arduino, robotics, embedded systems, and modern web development** comes to life.

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a young innovator blending circuits with code. Whether it's controlling motors using C++ on microcontrollers or creating full-stack web apps with React and Node.js — I love building things that move, think, and interact.
I'm also a youtuber named "NeoMindLab" and have a series called "Blueprint2Reality" where im making an ai enabled robot. you can check it out - www.youtube.com/@NeoMindLab
